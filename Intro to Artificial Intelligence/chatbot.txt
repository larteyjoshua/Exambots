A chatbot (also known as a talkbot, chatterbot, Bot, IM bot, interactive agent, or Artificial Conversational Entity) is a computer program or an artificial intelligence which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the Turing test. Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. Some chatterbots use sophisticated natural language processing systems, but many simpler systems scan for keywords within the input, then pull a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a database.

The term "ChatterBot" was originally coined by Michael Mauldin (creator of the first Verbot, Julia) in 1994 to describe these conversational programs.Today, most chatbots are either accessed via virtual assistants such as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, via messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger or WeChat, or via individual organizations' apps and websites. Chatbots can be classified into usage categories such as conversational commerce (e-commerce via chat), analytics, communication, customer support, design, developer tools, education, entertainment, finance, food, games, health, HR, marketing, news, personal, productivity, shopping, social, sports, travel and utilities.
Background
In 1950, Alan Turing's famous article "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" was published, which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence. This criterion depends on the ability of a computer program to impersonate a human in a real-time written conversation with a human judge, sufficiently well that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably�on the basis of the conversational content alone�between the program and a real human. The notoriety of Turing's proposed test stimulated great interest in Joseph Weizenbaum's program ELIZA, published in 1966, which seemed to be able to fool users into believing that they were conversing with a real human. However Weizenbaum himself did not claim that ELIZA was genuinely intelligent, and the Introduction to his paper presented it more as a debunking exercise:

[In] artificial intelligence ... machines are made to behave in wondrous ways, often sufficient to dazzle even the most experienced observer. But once a particular program is unmasked, once its inner workings are explained ... its magic crumbles away; it stands revealed as a mere collection of procedures ... The observer says to himself "I could have written that". With that thought he moves the program in question from the shelf marked "intelligent", to that reserved for curios ... The object of this paper is to cause just such a re-evaluation of the program about to be "explained". Few programs ever needed it more.

ELIZA's key method of operation (copied by chatbot designers ever since) involves the recognition of cue words or phrases in the input, and the output of corresponding pre-prepared or pre-programmed responses that can move the conversation forward in an apparently meaningful way (e.g. by responding to any input that contains the word 'MOTHER' with 'TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY').Thus an illusion of understanding is generated, even though the processing involved has been merely superficial. ELIZA showed that such an illusion is surprisingly easy to generate, because human judges are so ready to give the benefit of the doubt when conversational responses are capable of being interpreted as "intelligent".

Interface designers have come to appreciate that humans' readiness to interpret computer output as genuinely conversational�even when it is actually based on rather simple pattern-matching�can be exploited for useful purposes. Most people prefer to engage with programs that are human-like, and this gives chatbot-style techniques a potentially useful role in interactive systems that need to elicit information from users, as long as that information is relatively straightforward and falls into predictable categories. Thus, for example, online help systems can usefully employ chatbot techniques to identify the area of help that users require, potentially providing a "friendlier" interface than a more formal search or menu system. This sort of usage holds the prospect of moving chatbot technology from Weizenbaum's "shelf ... reserved for curios" to that marked "genuinely useful computational methods".

Development
The classic historic early chatbots are ELIZA (1966) and PARRY (1972).More recent notable programs include A.L.I.C.E., Jabberwacky and D.U.D.E (Agence Nationale de la Recherche and CNRS 2006). While ELIZA and PARRY were used exclusively to simulate typed conversation, many chatbots now include functional features such as games and web searching abilities. In 1984, a book called The Policeman's Beard is Half Constructed was published, allegedly written by the chatbot Racter (though the program as released would not have been capable of doing so).

One pertinent field of AI research is natural language processing. Usually, weak AI fields employ specialized software or programming languages created specifically for the narrow function required. For example, A.L.I.C.E. uses a markup language called AIML, which is specific to its function as a conversational agent, and has since been adopted by various other developers of, so called, Alicebots. Nevertheless, A.L.I.C.E. is still purely based on pattern matching techniques without any reasoning capabilities, the same technique ELIZA was using back in 1966. This is not strong AI, which would require sapience and logical reasoning abilities.

Jabberwacky learns new responses and context based on real-time user interactions, rather than being driven from a static database. Some more recent chatbots also combine real-time learning with evolutionary algorithms that optimise their ability to communicate based on each conversation held. Still, there is currently no general purpose conversational artificial intelligence, and some software developers focus on the practical aspect, information retrieval.

Chatbot competitions focus on the Turing test or more specific goals. Two such annual contests are the Loebner Prize and The Chatterbox Challenge (offline since 2015, materials can still be found from web archives).

According to Forrester (2015), AI will replace 16 percent of American jobs by the end of the decade.Chatbots have been used in applications such as customer service, sales and product education. However, a study conducted by Narrative Science in 2015 found that 80 percent of their respondents believe AI improves worker performance and creates jobs.[citation needed]

Messaging apps
Many companies' chatbots run on messaging apps like Facebook Messenger (since 2016), WeChat (since 2013),WhatsApp, LiveChat, Kik, Slack, Line, Telegram, or simply via SMS. They are used for B2C customer service, sales and marketing.

In 2016, Facebook Messenger allowed developers to place chatbots on their platform. There were 30,000 bots created for Messenger in the first six months, rising to 100,000 by September 2017.

Since September 2017, this has also been as part of a pilot program on WhatsApp. Airlines KLM and Aerom�xico both announced their participation in the testing;both airlines had previously launched customer services on the Facebook Messenger platform.

The bots usually appear as one of the user's contacts, but can sometimes act as participants in a group chat.

Many banks and insurers, media and e-commerce companies, airlines and hotel chains, retailers, health care providers, government entities and restaurant chains have used chatbots to answer simple questions, increase customer engagement,for promotion, and to offer additional ways to order from them.

A 2017 study showed 4% of companies used chatbots.According to a 2016 study, 80% of businesses said they intended to have one by 2020.

As part of company apps and websites
Previous generations of chatbots were present on company websites, e.g. Ask Jenn from Alaska Airlines which debuted in 2008 or Expedia's virtual customer service agent which launched in 2011.The newer generation of chatbots includes IBM Watson-powered "Rocky", introduced in February 2017 by the New York City-based e-commerce company Rare Carat to provide information to prospective diamond buyers.

Company internal platforms
Other companies explore ways they can use chatbots internally, for example for Customer Support, Human Resources, or even in Internet-of-Things (IoT) projects. Overstock.com, for one, has reportedly launched a chatbot named Mila to automate certain simple yet time-consuming processes when requesting for a sick leave.Other large companies such as Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Renault and Citro�n are now using automated online assistants instead of call centres with humans to provide a first point of contact. A SaaS chatbot business ecosystem has been steadily growing since the F8 Conference when Zuckerberg unveiled that Messenger would allow chatbots into the app.

Toys
Chatbots have also been incorporated into devices not primarily meant for computing such as toys.

Hello Barbie is an Internet-connected version of the doll that uses a chatbot provided by the company ToyTalk,which previously used the chatbot for a range of smartphone-based characters for children.These characters' behaviors are constrained by a set of rules that in effect emulate a particular character and produce a storyline.

IBM's Watson computer has been used as the basis for chatbot-based educational toys for companies such as CogniToys intended to interact with children for educational purposes.

Chatbot creation
The process of creating a chatbot follows a pattern similar to the development of a web page or a mobile app. It can be divided into Design, Building, Analytics and Maintenance.

Design
The chatbot design is the process that defines the interaction between the user and the chatbot.The chatbot designer will define the chatbot personality, the questions that will be asked to the users, and the overall interaction.It can be viewed as a subset of the conversational design. In order to speed up this process, designers can use dedicated chatbot design tools, that allow for immediate preview, team collaboration and video export.An important part of the chatbot design is also centered around user testing. User testing can be performed following the same principles that guide the user testing of graphical interfaces.

Building
The process of building a chatbot can be divided into two main tasks: understanding the user's intent and producing the correct answer. The first task involves understanding the user input. In order to properly understand a user input in a free text form, a Natural Language Processing Engine can be used.The second task may involve different approaches depending on the type of the response that the chatbot will generate.

Analytics
The usage of the chatbot can be monitored in order to spot potential flaws or problems. It can also provide useful insights that can improve the final user experience.

Maintenance
To keep chatbots up to speed with changing company products and services, traditional chatbot development platforms require ongoing maintenance. This can either be in the form of an ongoing service provider or for larger enterprises in the form of an in-house chatbot training team.To eliminate these costs, some startups are experimenting with Artificial Intelligence to develop self-learning chatbots, particularly in Customer Service applications.

Chatbot development platforms
The process of building, testing and deploying chatbots can be done on cloud based chatbot development platforms offered by cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers such as Yekaliva, Oracle Cloud Platform, SnatchBot and IBM Watson.These cloud platforms provide Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence and Mobile Backend as a Service for chatbot development.

APIs
There are many APIs available for building your own chatbots, such as AARC.

Malicious use
Malicious chatbots are frequently used to fill chat rooms with spam and advertisements, by mimicking human behaviour and conversations or to entice people into revealing personal information, such as bank account numbers. They are commonly found on Yahoo! Messenger, Windows Live Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger and other instant messaging protocols. There has also been a published report of a chatbot used in a fake personal ad on a dating service's website.

An expert system is an Artificial Intelligence program that has expert-level knowledge about a specific area and how to utilize its information to react appropriately.These systems have the expertise to substitute a human expert.

Artificial Intelligence is a field of computer science wherein the cognitive functions of the human brain are studied and tried to be replicated on a machine/system.Artificial Intelligence is today widely used for various applications like computer vision, speech recognition, decision-making, perception, reasoning, cognitive capabilities, and so on.

Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that shows how recursion might be utilized as a device in building up an algorithm to take care of a specific problem.Using a decision tree and a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm in AI, we can solve the Tower of Hanoi.

The Turing test is a method to test a machine’s ability to match the human-level intelligence.A machine is used to challenge human intelligence, and when it passes the test it is considered intelligent.Yet a machine could be viewed as intelligent without sufficiently knowing how to mimic a human.

A-star (A*) is a computer algorithm that is extensively used for the purpose of finding the path or traversing a graph in order to find the most optimal route between various points called the nodes.

A breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, used for searching tree or graph data structures, starts from the root node, then proceeds through neighboring nodes, and further moves toward the next level of nodes. Till the arrangement is found, it produces one tree at any given moment.As this pursuit can be executed utilizing the FIFO (first-in, first-out) data structure, this strategy gives the shortest path to the solution.

Depth-first search (DFS) is based on LIFO (last-in, first-out). A recursion is implemented with LIFO stack data structure.Thus, the nodes are in a different order than in BFS.The path is stored in each iteration from root to leaf nodes in a linear fashion with space requirement.

In a bidirectional search algorithm, the search begins in forward from the beginning state and in reverse from the objective state.The searches meet to identify a common state.The initial state is linked with the objective state in a reverse way.Each search is done just up to half of the aggregate way.

iterative deepening depth-first search algorithm is the repetitive search processes of level 1 and level 2 happen in this search.The search processes continue until the solution is found.Nodes are generated until a single goal node is created. Stack of nodes is saved.

The uniform cost search performs sorting in increasing the cost of the path to a node.It expands the least cost node.It is identical to BFS if each iteration has the same cost. It investigates ways in the expanding order of cost.

AI system uses game theory for enhancement; it requires more than one participant which narrows the field quite a bit.The two fundamental roles are as follows:
Participant design: Game theory is used to enhance the decision of a participant to get maximum utility
Mechanism design: Inverse game theory designs a game for a group of intelligent participants, e.g.auctions.

Alpha–Beta pruning is a search algorithm that tries to reduce the number of nodes that are searched by the minimax algorithm in the search tree.It can be applied to ‘n’ depths and can prune the entire subtrees and leaves

Fuzzy logic is a subset of AI; it is a way of encoding human learning for artificial processing.It is a form of many-valued logic.It is represented as IF-THEN rules.


A problem has to be solved in a sequential approach to attain the goal.The partial-order plan specifies all actions that need to be undertaken but specifies an order of the actions only when required.

First-order predicate logic is a collection of formal systems, where each statement is divided into a subject and a predicate.The predicate refers to only one subject, and it can either modify or define the properties of the subject.

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning which is used to create an artificial multi-layer neural network.It has self-learning capabilities based on previous instances, and it provides high accuracy.

Naive Bayes Machine Learning algorithm is a powerful algorithm for predictive modeling.It is a set of algorithms with a common principle based on Bayes Theorem.The fundamental Naive Bayes assumption is that each feature makes an independent and equal contribution to the outcome.

Perceptron is an algorithm that is able to simulate the ability of the human brain to understand and discard; it is used for the supervised classification of the input into one of the several possible non-binary outputs.

Ensemble learning is a computational technique in which classifiers or experts are strategically formed and combined.It is used to improve classification, prediction, function approximation, etc.of a model.

Regularization comes into the picture when a model is either overfit or underfit.It is basically used to minimize the error in a dataset.A new piece of information is fit into the dataset to avoid fitting issues.

Model accuracy, a subset of model performance, is based on the model performance of an algorithm. Whereas, model performance is based on the datasets we feed as inputs to the algorithm.

F1 score is the weighted average of precision and recall. It considers both false positive and false negative values into account.It is used to measure a model’s performance.

A recommendation system is an information filtering system that is used to predict user preference based on choice patterns followed by the user while browsing/using the system.

Bias error is used to measure how much on an average the predicted values vary from the actual values. In case a high-bias error occurs, we have an under-performing model.

Variance is used to measure how the predictions made on the same observation differ from each other.A high-variance model will overfit the dataset and perform badly on any observation.

A cost function is a scalar function that quantifies the error factor of the neural network. Lower the cost function better the neural network.For example, while classifying the image in the MNIST dataset, the input image is digit 2, but the neural network wrongly predicts it to be 3.


Strong AI makes the bold claim that computers can be made to think on a level (at least) equal to humans.Weak AI simply states that some "thinking-like" features can be added to computers to make them more useful tools and this has already started to happen (witness expert systems, drive-by-wire cars and speech recognition software). What does 'think' and 'thinking-like' mean? That's a matter of much debate.

start game 
It depends what the game does.If it's a two-player board game,look into the "Mini-max" search algorithm for games.In most commercial games, the AI is is a combination of high-level scripts and low-level efficiently-coded, real-time, rule-based systems.Often, commercial games tend to use finite state machines for computer players.Recently, discrete Markov models have been used to simulate unpredictible human players (the buzzword compliant name being "fuzzy" finite state machines)
A recent popular game, "Black and White", used machine learning techniques for the non-human controlled characters.Basic reinforcement learning, perceptrons and decision trees were all parts of the learning system.

 What Is An Agent
A very misused term.Today, an agent seems to mean a stand-alone piece of AI-ish software that scours across the internet doing something "intelligent." Russell and Norvig define it as "anything that can can be viewed a perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through effectors." Several papers I've read treat it as 'any program that operates on behalf of a human,' similar to its use in the phrase 'travel agent'. Marvin Minsky has yet another definition in the book "Society of Mind." Minsky's hypothesis is that a large number of seemingly-mindless agents can work together in a society to create an intelligent society of mind. Minsky theorizes that not only will this be the basis of computer intelligence, but it is also an explanation of how human intelligence works
Andrew Moore at Carnegie Mellon University once remarked that "The only proper use of the word 'agent' is when preceded by the words 'travel', 'secret', or 'double'."

Artificial intelligence Neural Networks can model mathematically the way biological brain works, allowing the machine to think and learn the same way the humans do- making them capable of recognizing things like speech, objects and animals like we do.

Less momery: The depth first search method takes less memory.

A heuristic function ranks alternatives, in search algorithms, at each branching step based on the available information to decide which branch to follow.

These are the two strategies which are quite similar. In best first search, we expand the nodes in accordance with the evaluation function. While, in breadth first search a node is expanded in accordance to the cost function of the parent node.

In Artificial Intelligence bayes rule to answer the probabilistic queries conditioned on one piece of evidence, Bayes rule can be used.

If a Bayesian Network is a representative of the joint distribution, then by summing all the relevant joint entries, it can solve any query.

In speech recognition, Acoustic signal is used to identify a sequence of words.

Artificial intelligence Neural Networks can model mathematically the way biological brain works, allowing the machine to think and learn the same way the humans do- making them capable of recognizing things like speech, objects and animals like we do.

Game theory, developed by American mathematician Josh Nash, is essential to AI because it plays an underlying role in how these smart algorithms improve over time
At its most basic, AI is about algorithms that are deployed to find solutions to problems. Game theory is about players in opposition trying to achieve specific goals.As most aspects of life are about competition, game theory has many meaningful real-world applications.
These problems tend to be dynamic. Some game theory problems are natural candidates for AI algorithms. So, whenever game theory is applied, multiple AI agents that interact with each other will only care about utility to itself.

A random forest is a data construct that is applied to ML projects to develop a large number of random decision trees while analyzing variables.
